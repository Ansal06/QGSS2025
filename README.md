# Qiskit Global Summer School 2025

This repository contains my work for the [IBM Quantum Global Summer School 2025 (QGSS25)]([https://github.com/qiskit-community/qgss-2025]), hosted by IBM Quantum and Qiskit. I'm documenting this to build habit as well as to maintain ready reference in the future for me or anybody looking to attend this school in the future.

## 🧠 Topics Covered
This time the theme of the school is: The Past, Present and Future of Quantum Computing. In this line, I hope we will cover the topics listed below as well as work on a project simultaneously.

So far, the following have been discussed: 
- Quantum Circuit Design
- Superposition and Entanglement
- Quantum Gates and Measurements
- Bloch Sphere Visualization
- Transpilation and Hardware Constraints
- Real-device Execution with `QiskitRuntimeService`
- Double-slit experiment, Entanglement and the CHSH game
- more to be added

## 📁 Structure

| Folder / File     | Description                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `lab0.ipynb`      | Introduction to quantum circuits and Qiskit basics |
| `README.md`       | This file – overview of the project              |
| *(more labs soon)*| Future notebooks for QGSS labs                   |

## 🚀 Environment

Running on [Qbraid](https://qbraid.com/), an integrated quantum development platform.

- Python 3.11
- Qiskit
- Jupyter Notebooks

## 📌 Goals

✔️ Complete all QGSS25 labs  
✔️ Submit assignments and projects

✔️ Document key learnings

✔️ Earn Badge of Excellence

🔜 Work on final quantum walks project and push to this repo  

## 📷 Sample Visualization(add to this later once you do some cool visualisation)

Here's a Bloch sphere example from Lab 0:
